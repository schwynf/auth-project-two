# Authentication for Project Two
This project showcases how to add authentication using `passport.js` library. Template for this project is the starter template given for Project Two.

`passport.js` provides many authentication strategies. This project makes use of **local** username and password authentication strategy. More details about this strategy can be found [here](http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-local/).

Passport Local strategy expects you to have username and password stored in your database. In this project I'm using email address as a username. The passwords are stored as a hash using **bcrypt**.

| `bcrypt` node package failing to install on Windows 7/10 machines. | From the `bcrypt` documentation, there are extra installations required on Windows OS to make `bcrypt` work. This is listed under the [Dependencies](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt#dependencies) section. To complete the required Windows dependencies install the tools as mentioned [here](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js/wiki/Installation-Instructions#microsoft-windows).
